======================

Some quite atrocious code from a quite dated data structures book that makes for an excellent refactoring exercise.

The initial code here _is not mine_. It is one of the example applications taken from the huge pile of example code provided on-line as part of a [10 year old Data Structures book](http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~sahni/dsaaj/). Since the code's not mine, I certainly can't just be slapping a license on it. Given that there hasn't been an update to the associated book in a decade, however, I'm hoping that no one is feeling terribly possessive of this code.

I'll at least add some tests and turn it into a proper project; I may also split it out into separate classes since that's not a terribly exciting or instructive exercise.
